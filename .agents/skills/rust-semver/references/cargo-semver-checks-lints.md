# cargo-semver-checks Lint Catalog

Reference for the most common lints emitted by [`cargo-semver-checks`](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/cargo-semver-checks). 270+ total; the high-value ones are listed here.

## How it works

`cargo-semver-checks` parses your crate's public API via `trustfall_rustdoc` (queries rustdoc JSON). It compares the current API against a baseline (a published version, git tag, or git rev) and reports each semver-relevant change.

## Run

```bash
cargo semver-checks check-release                            # vs latest crates.io
cargo semver-checks check-release --baseline-version 1.2.0   # vs specific version
cargo semver-checks check-release --baseline-tag v1.2.0      # vs git tag
cargo semver-checks check-release --baseline-rev <sha>       # vs git rev
```

Output format:

```

### Patch / informational

## Suppressing a lint

If you intentionally make a breaking change and want to acknowledge it (bumping major), the lints are informational. To silence false positives:

```rust
// Add a #[doc] hidden note that cargo-semver-checks recognizes:
// (not currently supported — file an issue if you hit a false positive)
```

Or filter by version:

```bash
cargo semver-checks check-release --release-type major  # acknowledge breaking
```

## CI integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/semver.yml
name: Semver
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  semver-checks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
      - uses: obi1kenobi/cargo-semver-checks-action@v2
        with:
          baseline-version: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}
```

PRs with breaking changes will fail unless the PR explicitly bumps the version.

## Common false positives

- Feature-gated items: cargo-semver-checks may not respect features in all cases
- `#[doc(hidden)]` items: still considered public API (correct behavior)
- Build-tag-specific code: rare

If you get a false positive, [file an issue](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/cargo-semver-checks/issues).
