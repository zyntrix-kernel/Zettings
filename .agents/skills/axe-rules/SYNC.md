notes: >
  DIVERGENCE: The canonical AXE_RULES_REFERENCE.md and AXE_RULES_COVERAGE.md
  files are now organized around a specific test-fixture scanner project
  (numbered test pages: page1.html-page6.html, auth/login.html, etc.) rather
  than a general-purpose rule reference. This skill preserves the prior
  general-purpose table format (rule ID -> category -> description, grouped by
  severity) and merges in the updated/expanded rule list from both canonical
  files. When re-syncing, keep the general-purpose framing as authoritative
  and pull only the rule list/severity updates from canonical.

  2026-07-27 update (mgifford/ACCESSIBILITY.md commit a4ccf27, "Release
  finding schema 2.1: add policy classification"): this skill does not have
  ACCESSIBILITY_FINDING_TRACKING.md as its canonical_source, but now
  references its "Policy Classification" vocabulary directly -- added a
  "Core Principle" paragraph requiring axe results to be preserved as raw
  outcomes and classified evidence_status "automated-indicator" /
  handling "review" until human-confirmed, and a note that axe's
  disabled-by-default AAA rules are obligation "aspirational" (not
  "advisory") under an AA target. This is a shared-vocabulary update, not
  an AXE_RULES_REFERENCE.md content sync -- see VOCABULARY_SYNC.md.
```

## How to Update This Skill

When the canonical source changes and CI flags drift:

1. Open both files side-by-side
2. Review the diff linked in the GitHub issue/PR comment
3. Update `SKILL.md` to reflect new requirements, changed patterns, or removed guidance
4. Set `last_synced_commit` to the current commit SHA of `mgifford/ACCESSIBILITY.md`
5. Rebuild: `cd skills && zip -r axe-rules.skill axe-rules/`
