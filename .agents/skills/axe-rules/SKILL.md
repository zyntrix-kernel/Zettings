  Load this skill when configuring axe-core scans, reviewing automated
  accessibility test results, or writing tests that use @axe-core/playwright,
  @axe-core/react, or similar integrations. Provides a quick reference to
  axe 4.x rule IDs, their WCAG mapping, and default severity levels.

# Axe-Core Rules Reference Skill

> **Canonical source**: `examples/AXE_RULES_REFERENCE.md` and `examples/AXE_RULES_COVERAGE.md` in `mgifford/ACCESSIBILITY.md`
> This skill is derived from those files. When in doubt, the example is authoritative.
> **Note:** the canonical files are organized around a specific test-fixture scanner
> project (numbered test pages). This skill re-presents the same rule set and
> severities as a general-purpose reference, independent of any particular fixture.

Apply these rules when writing, reviewing, or debugging axe-core scans.

## Core Principle

Axe-core catches ~30–40% of WCAG issues automatically. It is the baseline,
not the ceiling. Always pair automated scanning with manual keyboard and screen
reader testing.

**An axe-core result is evidence, not a conformance decision.** Preserve the
rule's raw outcome (`violations`, `incomplete`, `passes`, `inapplicable`)
exactly as axe reports it — do not overwrite or discard it when converting
to a project finding. Cite this file, `AXE_RULES_REFERENCE.md`, or the
rule's own `dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/` page as the authority for a
WCAG mapping; do not invent a mapping axe-core does not document for that
rule. Record an unreviewed `violations` result as
`evidence_status: automated-indicator` with `handling: review` — never as a
confirmed standards failure — until a human confirms it. See
[Accessibility Finding Tracking: Policy Classification](https://mgifford.github.io/ACCESSIBILITY.md/examples/ACCESSIBILITY_FINDING_TRACKING.html#policy-classification).

**Key tags to include in scans:**

```typescript
.withTags(['wcag2a', 'wcag2aa', 'wcag21aa', 'wcag22aa'])
```

Axe-core 4.11 includes 100+ automated checks across these categories: WCAG 2.0
A/AA (68 rules), WCAG 2.1 A/AA (26 rules), WCAG 2.2 A/AA (1 rule, disabled by
default), Best Practices (30+ rules), WCAG AAA (3 rules, disabled by default),
Experimental (9 rules, disabled by default), and Deprecated (7 rules, disabled
by default).

## Severity Scale (axe-core)

| axe severity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **critical** | Blocks access for one or more disability groups |
| **serious** | Significantly impairs access |
| **moderate** | Creates friction; workaround exists |
| **minor** | Best-practice gap; marginal impact |

## Moderate Rules — fix in near-term backlog

|---|---|---|
| `heading-order` | Headings | Heading levels skipped (e.g., h1 → h3) |

## Minor Rules

| Rule ID | Category | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `table-duplicate-name` | Tables | `<caption>` text duplicates `summary` attribute |
| `aria-deprecated-role` | ARIA | Deprecated ARIA role used |
| `server-side-image-map` | Keyboard | Server-side image map used |
| `aria-text` | ARIA (best practice) | `role="text"` on an element with focusable descendants |

Disabled-by-default rules (deprecated `marquee`/`blink`/`audio-caption`) are not
listed above — flag them if encountered, but they are not enabled in a default scan.

The three WCAG AAA rules axe-core disables by default report against a
level the project's AA target does not require. If enabled and a project
has not declared a broader target, classify a confirmed finding from one of
these rules as `obligation: aspirational`, not `advisory` — it is still a
real AAA-level finding, just not part of the AA baseline. Do not report
satisfying one of these rules as WCAG AAA conformance.

## Running axe-core in CI (Playwright)

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import AxeBuilder from '@axe-core/playwright';

test('No WCAG 2.x AA violations', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  const results = await new AxeBuilder({ page })
    .withTags(['wcag2a', 'wcag2aa', 'wcag21aa', 'wcag22aa'])
    .analyze();
  expect(results.violations).toEqual([]);
});
```

**Common configuration options:**

```typescript
// Exclude a specific element (use sparingly — document the reason)
.exclude('#known-false-positive')

// Include only a specific element
.include('#component-under-test')

// Disable a specific rule (document the reason and JIRA/issue link)
.disableRules(['color-contrast'])
```
