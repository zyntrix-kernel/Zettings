description: Implement and explain stable Rust language semantics with explicit toolchain and MSRV checks — ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, move semantics, traits, generics, associated types, pattern matching, closures, error propagation, and Edition differences. Use as the core Rust language skill when users ask for Rust syntax, compiler-error fixes, ownership/borrowing diagnoses, or version-sensitive stable code; hand std API selection (which collection, which smart pointer, which string type) to rust-stdlib, "how do I write X" pattern questions to rust-by-example, and specialized domains to their dedicated skills.

# Rust Stable Language Semantics

Use this skill for **language semantics**: ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, traits, generics, pattern matching, error propagation, and Edition differences. First verify the project's actual toolchain and Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV).

For **standard-library API selection** (which collection, which smart pointer, which string type, which I/O trait), use `rust-stdlib`. For **concrete pattern examples** ("how do I write X"), use `rust-by-example`.

## Prerequisites Before Starting

1. Run `rustc --version --verbose` and `cargo --version`.
2. Inspect the `rust-version` field in `rust-toolchain.toml`, `rust-toolchain`, and `Cargo.toml`.
3. Distinguish between three versions: local toolchain, project MSRV, and current official stable release.
4. When encountering version-sensitive APIs, consult [Current Stable Baseline](references/release-current.md) and rely on official release notes and API documentation as the final authority.
5. If a project is locked to an old version, strictly adhere only to syntaxes and APIs that are already stabilized for that specific version.

**Current Offline Baseline:** Rust 1.97.1 (released July 16, 2026). This is a dated repository baseline and does not update automatically.

## Capability Boundaries

### Suitable For Handling
- Ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and move semantics.
- `struct`, `enum`, pattern matching, traits, generics, and associated types.
- `Option`, `Result` error propagation, and custom errors (the *language mechanism*).
- Closures (`Fn`/`FnMut`/`FnOnce`), attribute syntax, format strings (the *language mechanism*).
- Modules, visibility modifiers, `pub`/`pub(crate)`/`pub(super)`.
- Edition differences (language-level — `unsafe extern`, RPIT capture, match ergonomics).
- Common compilation errors, borrowing check failures, and stable migration judgments.

Do not replace the complete workflow of domain-specific skills with this skill.

## Workflow

1. **Determine Version Boundaries** — Record toolchain version, edition, MSRV, and target platform(s).
2. **Narrow Problem Scope** — Determine whether the issue belongs to ownership/type system/standard library/compiler errors or a specialized domain.
3. **Read Minimal Resources** — Open only references directly relevant to the problem; do not load entire documentation sets at once.
4. **Implement Minimum Correct Solution** — Prioritize stable standard library usage, clear ownership semantics, and explicit error propagation.
5. **Run Quality Gate Checks** — Execute `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo check` (with all targets/features), and relevant tests.
6. **Handle Version Differences** — If an API is not supported by MSRV, choose the old compatible API or implement a compatibility shim; otherwise explicitly raise the MSRV.
7. **Transfer to Specialized Skills** — Load corresponding skills for async, unsafe macros, Web, embedded domains after entering those areas.

## Design Rules

- Prefer `&T` / `&mut T`; clone only when ownership transfer is required or independent lifetimes are needed.
- Use types to express invariants; prefer enums/newtypes over boolean parameters and unconstrained strings.
- Library code should return structured errors; application boundaries may add context before deciding how to display them.
- Prefer iterators and standard collections, but do not sacrifice readability for chain-of-call syntax.
- Do not use `unsafe` as a bypass for borrowing checks first prove that safe abstractions cannot express the requirement.
- Do not default third-party crate imports; compare against stable std, MSRV, maintenance cost, and supply chain risk.
- Never claim an API is stabilized in a specific version unless official release notes or an API page marked with `since` confirm it.

## Validation Gateways

Run validation gates from lowest to highest risk:

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo check --all-targets --all-features
cargo test --all-targets --all-features
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

If the project does not support `--all-features` or contains platform-specific targets, record reasons and use a defined feature/target matrix. For unsafe code, add `cargo miri test`; for MSRV issues, repeat `cargo check` and tests on the declared minimum toolchain.

## Required Documentation to Read On-Demand

### Version & Language Semantics
- [Current Stable Baseline](references/release-current.md): Latest version, compatibility notes, update steps.

### Cross-references (load the right skill instead)
- **"Which std collection / smart pointer / string type?"** → `rust-stdlib` (its `references/` covers collections, smart-pointers, string-types, iterators, I/O, interior-mutability, combinators, std-concurrency, process-and-fs, std-module-index)
- **"How do I write X?"** → `rust-by-example` (its `references/` covers conversions, flow-control, closures, modules, generics-traits, error-handling, attributes, unsafe, procedural-macros-overview, inline-asm, migrating-from-other-languages)
- **API design** → `rust-api-design`; **Cargo manifest** → `rust-cargo-build`; **dependency governance** → `rust-dependencies`

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Confusing "current stable" with project MSRV.
2. Running only `cargo check`, omitting tests, examples, benchmarks, or feature combinations.
3. Blindly using `clone`, wrapping in `Arc<Mutex<_>>`, or invoking `unsafe` solely to avoid borrowing errors.
4. Holding synchronous locks across `.await` calls in async code.
5. Describing versioned historical documentation as continuously updated resources.
6. Copying code snippets without including dependencies, features, error types, and platform constraints.
