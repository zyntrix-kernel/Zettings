notes: >
  Canonical example file exists in mgifford/ACCESSIBILITY.md.
  Skill content resynced.
  GAP FOUND: SKILL.md previously referenced `references/rules-part1.md` and
  `references/rules-part2.md` for the full 245-rule text, but these files do
  not exist anywhere in this skill directory (confirmed via `find`). Removed
  that dangling reference and pointed to the canonical guide / official
  checklist directly instead. If the intent was to ship a full rules
  reference alongside SKILL.md, those reference files still need to be authored.

  DIVERGENCE: This skill's format (YAML frontmatter, severity-tagged
  sections, condensed Definition of Done checklist) intentionally differs
  from the canonical file's prose structure. Content substance is synced;
  presentation format is not expected to match verbatim.
```

## How to Update This Skill

When the canonical source changes and CI flags drift:

1. Open both files side-by-side
2. Review the diff linked in the GitHub issue/PR comment
3. Update `SKILL.md` to reflect new requirements, changed patterns, or removed guidance
4. Set `last_synced_commit` to the current commit SHA of `mgifford/ACCESSIBILITY.md`
5. Rebuild: `cd skills && zip -r opquast-digital-quality.skill opquast-digital-quality/`
