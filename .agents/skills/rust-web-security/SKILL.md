# Rust Web Security Delivery

Establish attacker, asset, and trust boundaries first; then select crates and middleware. Rust's memory safety does not automatically provide authentication, authorization, protocol enforcement, or business logic security; default to deny all, and use negative testing to prove control is effective.

## Confirming the Security Contract

Before modifications:
- Identify service exposure surfaces, callers, browser/API/service-to-service traffic, and management endpoints;
- Determine where TLS terminates, which proxies are trusted, and how client IP/host/scheme originates;
- Define identity providers, authentication protocols, token/session types/lifecycles;
- Specify roles, scopes, object ownership, tenant boundaries, and sensitive business operations;
- Manage key storage/renewal for cookies, passwords, API keys, webhooks;
- Configure CORS, CSRF, redirects, uploads, outbound URLs, and webhook scenarios;
- Define rate limiting budgets per body size/parallelism/timeout requirements and abuse resistance policies;
- Establish audit event definitions, privacy standards, compliance needs, and incident response procedures;
- Lock versions of `axum`, `tower`, `rustls`, `cookie` crates along with Rust MSRV.

When security requirements are incomplete, explicitly state assumptions and uncovered risks. Do not bypass validation by weakening tests to achieve pass/fail outcomes.

## Workflow

### 1. Establish Attack Surface and Baselines
```bash
rustc --version --verbose
cargo metadata --format-version 1
cargo tree -e features
cargo test --all-targets
```
Enumerate all routes, methods, extractors, middleware proxies callbacks management endpoints outbound requests. Identify authentication context establishment points authorization decision points session/token storage key loading and audit logging locations. Run existing repository security gates; install or upgrade security tools must comply with project constraints.

### 2. Write Threat Model and Authorization Matrix
Record at minimum:
```text
Asset -> Entry Point -> Trust Boundary -> Attacker Capability -> Control -> Verification Evidence
```
Construct subject × action × resource × tenant × context matrices for each sensitive operation. Authentication only proves "who"; authorization must verify in every request whether the user can perform this action on that object. Default deny; do not rely solely on login checks or frontend button visibility.

Object-level, attribute-level, and tenant-based authorization details are available at [Threat Model and Authorization](references/threat-model-and-authorization.md).

### 3. Establish Identity in a Single Boundary
- Use mature IdP/protocols with maintained crates; do not invent token/password protocols yourself;
- Convert authentication results into minimal `Principal`/claims contexts;
- Failures of auth middleware must terminate requests without anonymous identity fallbacks to silent downgrade;
- Return 401 for missing or invalid credentials, and 403 when identity is known but permissions are denied;
- Management, internal, and user identities require distinct audiences, scopes, or credentials;
- For high-risk operations requiring re-authentication, MFA, or transactional confirmation without relying on stale sessions.

### 4. Correctly Validate Tokens, Sessions, and Passwords
JWT validation must enforce fixed allowed algorithms verifying signatures, issuer, audience, expiry, not-before, token type/scope requirements; different token types require mutually exclusive verification rules with JWKS caching/renewal handling. Decoding headers/claims does not constitute valid authentication.

Cookie sessions should include `Secure`, `HttpOnly` flags aligned to threat models for `SameSite`, minimal `Path`; typically omit broad `Domain`. Rotate session IDs after login and privilege escalation; define server-side invalidation and absolute/idle expiration upon logout or revocation.

Password hashing uses maintained password-hashing APIs with Argon2id-like parameters measured per deployment size; avoid generic fast hashes. Expensive KDFs must not block async runtime workers. API keys/tokens should be displayed once, stored in verifiable forms with scope prefixes, expiry, and renewal capabilities. OAuth/OIDC/JWT/session/password/API key details are covered at [Authentication Tokens and Sessions](references/auth-tokens-and-sessions.md).

### 5. Authorize Each Resource Boundary
- Authorization inputs include trusted principals, actions, actual resource attributes, and tenant;
- Query by tenant first, then object/field permissions to prevent BOLA/IDOR attacks;
- Management roles must have explicit scopes; do not treat `is_admin` as a global escape hatch;
- Batch operations authorize per-object or via equivalent database policies;
- Write DTOs use allowlists preventing mass assignment of sensitive fields like role, tenant, owner;
- Cached authorization results include policy version, subject, resource, action, and expiration.

Database Row Level Security (RLS) provides defense-in-depth but cannot replace application-level strategies and testing.

### 6. Harden Browser and Transport Boundaries
- Enforce full HTTPS coverage with HSTS, certificates, mTLS, and TLS policies validated at the actual termination layer;
- Trust only forwarded headers explicitly injected by trusted proxies to avoid host/scheme/IP spoofing;
- CORS defines browser read strategies rather than server-side access control; use precise origin allowlists when credentials are present;
Implement CSRF token defenses alongside state-changing cookie-based auth endpoints; rely on SameSite cookies solely to align protection against threats within the specific threat model.

Set Content Security Policy (CSP), frame, content-type, referrer, and cache headers matching the response body type. Apply rate limits on body size, header manipulation, uploads, pagination, parallelism, timeouts, and expensive operations. Prevent SSRF via user-controllable URL/webhook restrictions: limit scheme/host/port; parse all addresses to block private networks/metadata targets; re-verify after redirects.

Outbound responses also enforce size/type/time constraints. See [Browser Transport and Input](references/browser-transport-and-input.md) for specific checks.

### 7. Protect Secrets and Establish Audit
- Inject secrets from controlled configuration/secret managers into code, image layers, errors, or logs only; use `secrecy` types to reduce accidental exposure via Debug serialization without claiming memory isolation equivalence;
- Explicitly define key ID, owner, purpose, algorithm, creation/expiry/renewal/cancellation policies;
- Mark/sanitize sensitive body content before trace logging; audit login failures, permission denials, policy/role/key changes and high-risk operations.

Audit records must include actor, action, target, outcome, request ID, and timestamp without secrets. Prevent log injection attacks by limiting the number of attacker-controllable labels. Rotating or revoking production keys, sessions, users, tokens alters external state; only explicitly authorized actions may execute these changes.

### 8. Prove Control via Negative Testing
Cover at least:
1. Unauthenticated/expired requests with invalid issuer/audience/algorithms/token types;
2. Tenant-level permission gaps (same tenant vs cross-tenant), object ownership, and field-level privilege escalation;
3. Session fixation, logout/revoke scenarios, absolute/idle expiration policies;
4. CSRF/CORS preflight attacks against malicious origins/cookie attributes;
5. SSRF via private networks, IPv6, DNS multi-address resolution, redirects, non-HTTP schemes;
6. Large body sizes, slow requests, high concurrency costs and expensive authentication flows;
7. Error responses leaking trace IDs or audit log secrets;
8. Dependency vulnerabilities and feature/crypto backend changes.

## Common Gates
```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo check --all-targets
cargo test --all-targets
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo audit
```
`cargo audit` requires the tool and advisory data to be available. If either is unavailable, report that the audit was not run rather than claiming a pass. Supplement it with `cargo deny`, DAST, proxy/TLS configuration tests, and authorization-matrix validation according to repository policy.

## Completion Criteria
- Threat model, trust boundaries, and authorization matrices are explicit;
- All sensitive routes default to deny all and verify object/tenant/action ownership;
- Tokens/sessions/passwords/API keys use mature protocols with complete verification;
- TLS/proxies/CORS/CSRF/header/resource limits align with actual deployment configurations;
- Secrets do not appear in responses/logs; rotation/revoke policies are explicit;
- Negative testing and dependency audits pass; unverified IdP, proxies, TLS or production configs explicitly marked.
