notes: >
  Canonical example file exists in mgifford/ACCESSIBILITY.md.
  Skill content resynced from canonical source in full, folding new sections
  (print button, running headers/footers, grayscale testing checklist,
  progressive enhancement framing, expanded WCAG table) into the existing
  severity-tagged skill format.

  DIVERGENCE: This skill's format (YAML frontmatter, severity-tagged
  sections, condensed Definition of Done checklist) intentionally differs
  from the canonical file's prose structure. Content substance is synced;
  presentation format is not expected to match verbatim.
```

## How to Update This Skill

When the canonical source changes and CI flags drift:

1. Open both files side-by-side
2. Review the diff linked in the GitHub issue/PR comment
3. Update `SKILL.md` to reflect new requirements, changed patterns, or removed guidance
4. Set `last_synced_commit` to the current commit SHA of `mgifford/ACCESSIBILITY.md`
5. Rebuild: `cd skills && zip -r print.skill print/`
