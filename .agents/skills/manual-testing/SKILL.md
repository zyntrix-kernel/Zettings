  Load this skill whenever you are planning, executing, or reviewing manual
  accessibility testing. Manual testing with real assistive technologies is
  essential — automated tools catch only ~30–40 % of WCAG issues. Absolutely
  always include keyboard-only testing and at least one screen reader test
  before marking a feature accessible. Under no circumstances skip forced
  colors mode testing for UI components.

# Manual Accessibility Testing Skill

> **Canonical source**: `examples/MANUAL_ACCESSIBILITY_TESTING_GUIDE.md` in `mgifford/ACCESSIBILITY.md`
> This skill is derived from that file. When in doubt, the example is authoritative.

Apply these rules when planning or reviewing manual accessibility testing.

---

## Severity Scale (this skill)

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Critical** | Issue completely blocks a core task for one or more disability groups |
| **Serious** | Significantly impairs access; workaround unreasonable to expect |
| **Moderate** | Creates friction; workaround exists and is not too burdensome |
| **Minor** | Best-practice gap; marginal impact on access |

---

## Core Principle

**Manual testing reveals issues that automated tools cannot detect**, including:

* Screen reader announcement quality and user experience
* Keyboard navigation flow and logical sequence
* Focus management in dynamic interfaces
* Context and orientation for assistive technology users
* Forced colors mode (Windows High Contrast) — automated tools cannot simulate OS-level color overrides
* Real-world usability barriers

---

## Critical: When Manual Testing Is Required

Perform manual testing:

* **Before each release** — test critical user flows end to end
* **After UI changes** — test all affected components
* **For new features** — test complete user workflows
* **When automated tests pass** — validate actual user experience
* **When accessibility bugs are reported** — reproduce and verify fixes

**Getting started:** test keyboard-only first (easiest entry point), then learn
basic screen reader commands for your platform. Practice on familiar websites
before testing your own. Focus on one component or flow at a time.

---

## Critical: Keyboard-Only Testing

**Every interactive element must be reachable and operable by keyboard alone.**

Steps:
1. Click in the browser address bar, then press Tab to start from page top
2. Tab through entire page; check each focusable element:
   - Is focus visible (clear outline or highlight)?
   - Is focus order logical (follows visual/reading order)?
   - Can you activate it? (Enter for links/buttons, Space for buttons/checkboxes)
3. Press Shift+Tab to reverse through elements
4. Confirm there are no keyboard traps (can you Tab away from every element?)

Key shortcuts to verify:

| Key | Expected behaviour |
|---|---|
| Tab | Move focus forward |
| Shift+Tab | Move focus backward |
| Enter | Activate links, buttons, submit forms |
| Space | Activate buttons, toggle checkboxes |
| Arrow keys | Navigate within components (menus, tabs, radio groups) |
| Escape | Close dialogs, cancel operations |
| Home / End | Jump to start/end of component |

**Component-specific checks:**

* **Forms:** all fields reachable; labels and required state announced; errors
  appear and are announced; Enter submits; can cancel/reset if applicable
* **Buttons:** Enter and Space both activate; visual feedback on activation;
  focus moves appropriately after activation
* **Links:** Enter activates; destination clear from link text; skip links work
* **Dropdowns/select menus:** arrow keys navigate options; Escape closes;
  selected value announced
* **Modal dialogs:** focus moves in on open; focus trapped inside; Escape
  closes (unless critical); focus returns to trigger on close
* **Custom widgets (tabs, accordions, carousels):** follow WAI-ARIA keyboard
  patterns; arrow keys and Home/End work as documented; state changes are clear

---

## Critical: Screen Reader Testing

**Recommended platform pairings:**

* NVDA + Firefox or Chrome (Windows)
* JAWS + Chrome or Firefox (Windows)
* VoiceOver + Safari (macOS / iOS)
* TalkBack + Chrome (Android)

**Basic test procedure:**

1. Start screen reader (NVDA: Ctrl+Alt+N; VoiceOver macOS: Cmd+F5)
2. Navigate by headings (NVDA/JAWS: H / Shift+H) — do they form a logical outline?
3. Navigate by landmarks (NVDA/JAWS: D / Shift+D) — are `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>` identified?
4. Navigate by form controls (NVDA/JAWS: F / Shift+F) — are labels announced?
5. Read all content — is order logical? Any missing or confusing announcements?

**Component-specific screen reader checks:**

* **Images:** decorative images ignored (empty alt/`aria-hidden`); informative
  images have descriptive alt text; complex images have longer descriptions
* **Links:** purpose clear from announcement alone; text meaningful (not
  "click here"); external links/new windows indicated
* **Buttons:** label describes the action; pressed/toggle state announced;
  disabled state announced
* **Form fields:** label announced before field type; required state,
  instructions/hints, error messages, and success messages all announced
* **Dynamic content:** new/deleted content announced via live regions; loading
  states and progress communicated
* **Tables:** navigate by rows/cells (Ctrl+Alt+Arrow in NVDA/JAWS); column and
  row headers announced with each cell; table purpose clear (caption or `aria-label`)
* **Custom widgets:** role announced (e.g., "tab", "menu", "dialog"); state
  announced (e.g., "selected", "expanded"); instructions provided for complex widgets

**For each interactive element, verify:**

* Element type is announced (button, link, heading…)
* Label/name is clear and descriptive
* Current value is announced (form fields)
* State is announced (checked, selected, expanded…)
* Changes are announced (dynamic updates, live regions)

## Serious: Forced Colors Mode Testing

**Why automated tools miss this:** forced colors is triggered by an OS-level
setting that replaces all author-defined colors with a constrained system
palette. Automated tools cannot simulate the OS-level override, detect which
elements become invisible when custom colors are stripped, or assess whether
focus indicators/icons/custom controls survive the substitution.

**How to enable:**

* **Windows 11:** Settings → Accessibility → Contrast themes → choose a theme → Apply
* **Windows 10:** Settings → Ease of Access → High Contrast → turn on (or `Alt+Left Shift+Print Screen`)
* **Chrome/Edge DevTools:** F12 → More Tools → Rendering → "Emulate CSS media feature forced-colors" → `active`
* **Firefox:** `about:config` → `ui.forcedColors` → set to `1` (`-1` to reset)
* **Polypane** includes a forced-colors emulation panel

Always verify with real OS settings before release — DevTools emulation is
convenient but not fully equivalent.

**What to look for:**

* [ ] All text is readable against its background (`CanvasText` on `Canvas`)
* [ ] Buttons have a visible boundary; links distinguishable from body text;
      form fields have visible borders
* [ ] Keyboard focus outlines are visible (`outline` is preserved; `box-shadow` may not be)
* [ ] SVG icons are visible (use `currentColor` for `fill`/`stroke`)
* [ ] Custom checkboxes / radio buttons remain visible and distinguishable;
      toggle state shown via text/ARIA/outline, not color alone
* [ ] Error states are identifiable without relying on color alone; required
      fields marked with text or icons, not only color
* [ ] Background images that convey meaning have a text/ARIA alternative
* [ ] Charts/data visualizations use pattern/texture/label alternatives

**Common fixes:**

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `box-shadow` focus ring disappears | Replace with `outline` |
| SVG icon invisible | Use `currentColor` for `fill`/`stroke` |
| Custom checkbox invisible | Add visible border; use `forced-color-adjust` override |
| Error marked by color only | Add icon, text label, or `aria-invalid` |
| Input invisible (`border: none`) | Add `border: 1px solid ButtonBorder` in `@media (forced-colors: active)` |
| Background image removed | Add visible text, caption, or `aria-label` |

**CSS system color keywords for patching:**

```css
@media (forced-colors: active) {
  :focus-visible {
    outline: 3px solid Highlight;
    outline-offset: 2px;
  }
  .custom-checkbox::before {
    forced-color-adjust: none;
    border: 2px solid ButtonBorder;
    background-color: ButtonFace;
  }
  .custom-checkbox[aria-checked="true"]::before {
    background-color: Highlight;
  }
}
```

Relevant keywords: `Canvas`, `CanvasText`, `ButtonFace`, `ButtonText`,
`ButtonBorder`, `Highlight`, `HighlightText`, `LinkText`, `VisitedText`, `GrayText`.

Use `forced-color-adjust: none` only as a last resort — it opts the element out
of forced colors entirely and can negate the user's accessibility settings.

## Moderate: Visual Accessibility Checks

### Color contrast

* Normal text (< 18 pt or < 14 pt bold): 4.5:1 minimum
* Large text (≥ 18 pt or ≥ 14 pt bold): 3:1 minimum
* UI components and graphics: 3:1 minimum
* Focus indicators: 3:1 against adjacent colors

Test with: WebAIM Contrast Checker, browser DevTools. Test light and dark
color modes separately.

### SC 1.4.4 Resize Text vs. SC 1.4.10 Reflow — do not conflate

These are two distinct success criteria with different tests. A page can
pass one and fail the other, and horizontal scrolling at 200% zoom is not
automatically a failure of either.

**SC 1.4.4 Resize Text (AA):** content must be resizable up to 200% without
loss of content or functionality. Checks text enlargement specifically — it
does not itself require eliminating horizontal scrolling.

1. Set browser zoom to 200% (Ctrl/Cmd + +)
2. Verify all content is readable and not cut off or overlapping
3. Verify functionality (menus, forms, controls) still works at 200%
4. Also test with OS-level screen magnification (Windows Magnifier, macOS Zoom)

**SC 1.4.10 Reflow (AA):** content must be presented without loss of
information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two
dimensions, at a viewport width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels (a common way
to test this on desktop is a 1280px-wide viewport at 400% zoom — the two
are equivalent).

1. Set the viewport to 320 CSS pixels wide (or 400% zoom on a 1280px viewport)
2. Verify content does not require horizontal scrolling to read, for
   non-excepted content — see the exception below
3. Verify no content is cut off, overlapped, or hidden
4. Verify interactive elements remain operable
5. Verify reading order, relationships, and operation are preserved without
   relying on the original visual layout

**The exception, precisely:** SC 1.4.10 exempts only **parts of content
that require two-dimensional layout for their usage or meaning** — not the
page as a whole. Normative examples: data tables, maps, diagrams, video
players, games, presentations, interfaces requiring a persistently visible
toolbar. An excepted component does not exempt the rest of the page (the
heading above a data table, filters, search, pagination must still reflow).
Within an excepted component, individual sections may still need to
reflow. "Requires" is a meaning test, not a convenience test — a component
that merely looks better in a wide fixed layout, without losing information
or functionality if it reflowed, is not exempt.

A page that triggers horizontal scroll at 400% zoom (or the 320px
equivalent) is a high-value indicator that Reflow has not been achieved,
but investigate whether the overflowing content falls within the exception
before concluding a failure. See
[Behavioral Accessibility Automation](https://github.com/mgifford/ACCESSIBILITY.md/blob/main/examples/BEHAVIORAL_ACCESSIBILITY_AUTOMATION.md#4-reflow-risk-in-detail)
(`skills/behavioral-a11y/SKILL.md`) for a reusable, tested Playwright Reflow
risk indicator and its documented limitations — it is an indicator, not a
Reflow conformance check; human judgment is still required to confirm the
exception, verify content isn't cut off, and test actual content at 400% zoom.

### Focus indicator: three distinct success criteria

**SC 2.4.7 Focus Visible (AA):** every keyboard-focusable element must have
a visible focus indicator. Binary check — either a visible indicator exists
or it does not.

* [ ] Focus indicator is visible for every focusable element
* [ ] Focus indicator is not removed unless replaced with a superior alternative
* [ ] Focus indicator is not obscured by other content

**SC 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (AA):** focus indicators on UI components must
have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colors. Applies to
the indicator itself, not the component's normal state.

* [ ] Focus indicator contrast meets 3:1 against adjacent colors, measured
      against the indicator color and the adjacent background/component color
* [ ] Custom focus styles meet the contrast requirement (not just the default outline)

**SC 2.4.13 Focus Appearance (AAA):** stricter than SC 2.4.7 — requires a
minimum area equal to the focusable element's perimeter × 2 CSS pixels, a
3:1 contrast ratio between focused and unfocused states, and the indicator
must not be fully obscured by author-created content. Projects targeting AA
are not required to meet this, but meeting it provides stronger
accessibility; document whether your project targets it.

**Behavioral screenshot-difference testing:** the
[CWAC](https://github.com/GOVTNZ/cwac/) project's `FocusIndicatorAudit`
sends real Tab presses and compares whole-page screenshots before/after
each press, reporting a finding when no pixels changed. It does **not**
measure contrast (SC 1.4.11), prove a detected change is local to the
focused element (its comparison is whole-page), determine an indicator is
sufficiently perceptible, or distinguish a missing indicator from one
obscured by other content. This repository's own reusable implementation
(`skills/behavioral-a11y/SKILL.md`,
[`focus-visible-risk.mjs`](https://github.com/mgifford/ACCESSIBILITY.md/blob/main/examples/playwright/focus-visible-risk.mjs))
is an independent reimplementation of the documented method that instead
captures a fresh unfocused/focused screenshot pair scoped to a padded
region around each element, closing some of CWAC's whole-page limitations
while introducing its own documented tradeoffs. Neither implementation, nor
any screenshot-diff approach alone, verifies SC 1.4.11 (contrast) or SC
2.4.13 (minimum area). Use screenshot-difference testing as a supplementary
check alongside manual verification, not as a sole focus indicator test.

## Testing Workflows by Component Type

**Forms:** navigate to form with keyboard only → fill all fields (check Tab
order) → trigger validation errors → verify errors appear and are announced →
correct and revalidate → submit with Enter/Space → verify success message is
announced. With a screen reader, also confirm field labels/instructions/types
are announced and errors are in logical reading order.

**Modal dialogs:** activate trigger → verify focus moves into modal → Tab
through all elements → verify Tab doesn't leave modal (focus trap) → Escape or
close button dismisses → verify focus returns to trigger. With a screen
reader, confirm the modal is announced (`role="dialog"`, `aria-labelledby`)
and content is in logical reading order.

**Single Page Applications:** click a navigation link → verify content changes
→ verify focus moves to main heading/content → verify page title changes →
verify the route change is announced or focus provides context. Confirm the
back button works and new page structure (landmarks, headings) is clear.

## Encouraging Participation from People with Disabilities

People with disabilities are the experts in identifying barriers and
validating solutions — their lived experience surfaces issues automated tools
and non-disabled testers miss, and validates that fixes actually work.

* Remove barriers to participation: clear jargon-free instructions, flexible
  timeframes, asynchronous feedback, compensation for testing time, accessible
  issue-reporting formats
* Invite diverse testers: screen reader users, keyboard-only users, voice
  control users, users with cognitive disabilities, users with multiple disabilities
* Credit and compensate testers fairly; create opportunities for ongoing involvement
