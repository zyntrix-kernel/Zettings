# Sync Metadata

Links this skill to its canonical source. Read by `.github/workflows/skill-sync-check.yml`.

## Source

```yaml
canonical_source: examples/IMAGE_ALT_TEXT_ACCESSIBILITY_BEST_PRACTICES.md
last_synced_commit: "bb235f3"
last_synced_date: "2026-07-21"
skill_maintainer: ""
notes: >
  Canonical example file exists in mgifford/ACCESSIBILITY.md.
  Skill content resynced, folding in new sections: identity/sensitive-attribute
  guidance (do not guess race, disability, emotion, etc.), CMS/authoring
  workflow requirements, AI-assisted alt text guidance, image maps, and
  responsive image/art-direction guidance.

  DIVERGENCE: This skill's format (YAML frontmatter, severity-tagged
  sections, condensed Definition of Done checklist) intentionally differs
  from the canonical file's prose structure. Content substance is synced;
  presentation format is not expected to match verbatim.
```

## How to Update This Skill

When the canonical source changes and CI flags drift:

1. Open both files side-by-side
2. Review the diff linked in the GitHub issue/PR comment
3. Update `SKILL.md` to reflect new requirements, changed patterns, or removed guidance
4. Set `last_synced_commit` to the current commit SHA of `mgifford/ACCESSIBILITY.md`
5. Rebuild: `cd skills && zip -r image-alt-text.skill image-alt-text/`
